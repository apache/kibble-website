NOTE: This is now handled by the buildbot, you only need to change the markdown
      files and the buildbot will regenerate the site and publish it.
      
# Building the web site

* Install the markdown module for Python 3: sudo pip3 install markdown
* Edit or create the appropriate markdown file in source/ (you can have sub-dirs there)
* open a shell, go to the source/ dir
* Run: python3 generate.py
* Commit the changes to git :)
